We are going to performe Twitter sentiment analysis on our Dataset using machine learning algorithms, by developing a machine learning pipeline 
involving the use of three classifiers (Logistic Regression, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, and SVM)along with using Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). 
The performance of these classifiers is then evaluated using accuracy and F1 Scores.
For data preprocessing, we will be using Natural Language Processingâ€™s (NLP) NLTK library.
